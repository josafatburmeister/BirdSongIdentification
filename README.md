## Abstract

<div style="text-align: justify">
Audio recorders that capture bird vocalizations are increasingly used in conservation biology to monitor bird
populations. However, labeling the collected audio data requires trained ornithologists and is a very time-consuming task. To facilitate training of deep learning models that automate the labeling process, this work implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for the automatic recognition of bird vocalizations in audio files. The presented pipeline can be run both as a notebook and as a Kubeflow pipeline. The pipeline includes steps for collecting and downloading suitable training data, preprocessing and filtering the training data, and training, tuning, and evaluating deep learning models. 
The pipeline is evaluated using an example sample dataset with ten different bird vocalization classes from the Xeno-Canto database. On this dataset an average F<sub>1</sub>-score of ... is achieved.
